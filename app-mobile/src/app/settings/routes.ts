/**
 * Typed Settings stack route contract — ONE navigation system for the
 * Settings tab. The native stack hosts, in hierarchy order:
 *
 *   root (settings summary) → advanced / device-management
 *                           → TemplateList → CreateTemplate
 *                                          → RoomList → CreateRoom
 *                                                     → RoomDashboard
 *                                                     → EditRoomDashboard
 *
 * The Template → Room → Widget management hierarchy is reachable ONLY from
 * here (one management entry on the root screen); the Dashboard tab is the
 * view-only surface and hosts no navigation. The previous hand-written
 * `routeMachine` is retired — transitions are React Navigation's stack
 * (push/pop/back) and are covered by {@link ./SettingsNavigator.test.tsx}.
