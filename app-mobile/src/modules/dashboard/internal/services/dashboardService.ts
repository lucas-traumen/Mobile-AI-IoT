/**
 * Dashboard service — owns the persisted Templates file (CRUD + widget
 * editing) behind one deep interface.
 *
 * Model 1A (approved): a Template is a presentation/layout profile over the
 * SAME physical smart home. Physical rooms are owned by the devices module;
 * Templates own ORDERED room references + per-reference widget layouts.
 * Duplicating a Template/room copies only ids/layouts — never physical
 * rooms, devices, MQTT topics or History identities.
 *
 * Every mutation:
 * 1. validates against the widget registry (`type` must exist, binding must
 *    satisfy `validateWidgetBinding` + the room-authoritative check, size
 *    must be supported),
 * 2. applies the pure layout engine (findFreeSlot / applyMove / applyResize /
 *    compactVertical),
 * 3. persists through the repository (one atomic save — nothing is applied
 *    on error),
 * 4. updates the mirror store + publishes `dashboards:changed { activeId }`,
 * 5. stamps the touched Template's `updatedAt` (Clock-injected) — the latest
 *    successful Template-owned mutation (metadata, membership/order or
 *    widget-layout save). Selection changes, shared physical-room renames
 *    and live MQTT readings never touch it.
 *
 * Load-time migrations (deterministic, idempotent, never over valid data):
 * - retired built-in widget types are removed across every Template room
 *   with the minimal migration-specific layout repair (custom/unknown
 *   widgets keep their exact coordinates),
 * - exact-duplicate approved placements are deduplicated (first wins),
 * - untouched legacy seed relay layouts are normalized,
 * - a LEGACY (pre-Template) file — already structurally migrated by the
 *   schema layer — has its room references re-ordered by the devices
 *   registry order and its `updatedAt` stamped; the migrated snapshot is
 *   persisted once (a storage failure keeps the in-memory truth and the
 *   next load retries; the persisted file is only ever replaced, never
 *   reseeded),
 * - a Template with `updatedAt === 0` (first-run seed / migration) gets the
 *   real Clock timestamp.
