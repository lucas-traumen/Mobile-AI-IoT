/**
 * DashboardGrid — the widget card grid with two presentation modes.
 *
 * DEFAULT `'absolute'` (the editor contract): absolute-positioned 2-column
 * grid driven by the persisted coordinates. Pure rendering + gesture
 * handling; grid math comes from the pure `gridMetrics` module
 * (`computeGridMetrics` / `pixelRect` / `snapToGrid`).
 *
 * Edit mode per card (absolute mode only):
 * - drag (PanResponder): the card translates by (dx, dy); on release the
 *   target grid cell is `orig + snapToGrid(...)` and `onMoveWidget` is
 *   called. On an error result the translation is dropped (the card snaps
 *   back to its persisted position — the store did not change). Dropping
 *   onto a cell OCCUPIED by another widget of the same grid swaps the two
 *   positions via the opt-in `onSwapWidgets` seam (fix cycle 8 L, the room
 *   editor) instead of the doomed move. Targets that would render the card
 *   above its section (negative section-local row, fix cycle 8 H) are
 *   rejected before any callback, AND the in-flight translation is clamped
 *   to the section so the dragged card can never be seen above its section
 *   container DURING the gesture either ({@link clampedDragTranslation},
 *   fix cycle 8 H completion).
 * - remove: `×` top-right → `onRemoveWidget`.
 * - resize: bottom-right button cycles the definition's `supportedSizes` in
 *   order → `onResizeWidget`.
 *
 * OPT-IN `'stacked'` (view-only narrow-canvas reflow, presentation-only):
 * cards render in flow — one full-width card per row in the given order,
 * each using the widget's PERSISTED row height while the persisted `x/y`
 * coordinates are never read or rewritten (no drag/resize/remove chrome:
 * the stacked mode is a view-only presentation; the editor never uses it).
 *
 * Card appearance seam (opt-in): `'default'` (the editor contract) renders
 * neutral theme surfaces (surface + border, no tint); `'smart'` — the Smart
 * Home view recipe (dashboard-smart-home-redesign) — paints each card with
 * the `smart` card surface + hairline `smart` border + smart shadow + the
 * `smart.radius.card` token radius. The former `'gel'` branch (pastel
 * History card recipe) was REMOVED with the Settings smart sync (scope
 * amendment 1): its last consumer (`RoomDashboardScreen`) moved to
 * `'smart'`, and the gel tokens were retired — every surface (Dashboard,
 * History, Settings + the shared overlays) now consumes the `smart` block.
 *
 * GROWTH-SAFE SMART VIEW (fix cycle 2): the smart card heights are
 * per-TYPE `minHeight` FLOORS (D4 + scope amendment 2: sensor rows floor
 * at the compact ~136 policy, switch rows render compact ~92) and the
 * smart inner layer never clips
 * (`overflow: 'visible'`), so longer inline errors or font-scaled text
 * GROW the card instead of being cut off. Because a grown card must never
 * overlap its siblings nor escape the scrollable extent, the smart view
 * (never edit mode) renders in NORMAL FLOW in BOTH presentations:
 * - `'stacked'`: one full-width card per row (the established reflow),
 * - `'absolute'` (wide canvas): TWO persisted-derived columns per row —
 *   the pure `smartFlowLayout` maps the persisted coordinates to
 *   row/column/span (presentation-only); a grown card makes its flow row
 *   taller, the row's sibling stretches, and every following row/section
 *   is pushed down (Yoga flow), so the ScrollView extent always covers the
 *   real content. No absolute positioning exists in the smart view at all.
 * The editor (edit mode) and `'default'` callers keep the exact persisted
 * slot grid byte-identical — the editor's uniform-row contract is
 * untouched.
